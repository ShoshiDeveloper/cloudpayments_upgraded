# cloudpayments
## This package is upgraded [cloudpayments](https://pub.dev/packages/cloudpayments)

A Flutter plugin for integrating Cloudpaymanets in Android and iOS applications.

__Disclaimer__: It is not an official plugin. It uses [SDK-Android](https://github.com/cloudpayments/SDK-Android) on Android and [SDK-IOS](https://github.com/cloudpayments/SDK-iOS) on iOS.
Also this plugin doesn't send any requests to Cloudpayments API. In order to make purchases you have to implment some logic on your server.

Steps to make purchase:
- In the application, you need to obtain card data: number, expiration date, holder's name, and CVV;
- Create a card data cryptogram using this plugin;
- Send a cryptogram and all data for payment from a mobile device to your server;
- Make a payment via API call with your server.

See the official documentation:
- [Android](https://developers.cloudpayments.ru/#sdk-dlya-android)
- [iOS](https://developers.cloudpayments.ru/#sdk-dlya-ios)

- [X] Check the validity of the card's parameters.
- [X] Generate card cryptogram packet.
- [X] Show 3ds dialog.
- [X] Google Pay payments.
- [X] Apple Pay payments.

## Getting Started

### Initializing for Android

If you want to show 3ds dialog on Android, make MainActivity implements `FlutterFragmentActivity` instead of `FlutterActivity`

`android/app/src/main/.../MainActivity.kt`:

```kotlin
import io.flutter.embedding.android.FlutterFragmentActivity

class MainActivity: FlutterFragmentActivity() {}
```

## Usage

- Check card number validity.

```dart
bool isValid = await Cloudpayments.isValidNumber(cardNumber);
```

- Check card expire date.

```dart
bool isValid = await Cloudpayments.isValidExpireDate(cardNumber); // MM/yy
```

- Generate card cryptogram packet. You need to get your publicId from your [personal account](https://merchant.cloudpayments.ru/login).

```dart
final cryptogram = await Cloudpayments.cardCryptogram(cardNumber, expireDate, cvcCode, publicId);
```

- Showing 3DS form and get results of 3DS auth.

```dart
final result = await Cloudpayments.show3ds(acsUrl, transactionId, paReq);
```

## Apple Pay

- Create instance of CloudpaymentsApplePay.

```dart
final applePay = CloudpaymentsApplePay();
```

- Check whether Apple Pay is available on this device and can process payment requests.

```dart
final isApplePayAvailable = await applePay.isApplePayAvailable();
```

- Request payment.

```dart
final paymentToken = await applePay.requestApplePayPayment(
    merchantId: 'merchant.com.YOURDOMAIN',
    currencyCode: 'RUB',
    countryCode: 'RU',
    products: [
        {"name": "Red apple", "price": "170"},
        {"name": "Mango", "price": "250.50"},
        {"name": "Delivery", "price": "100"},
        {"name": "Discount", "price": "-89.90"},
        {"name": "Total", "price": "430.60"},
    ],
);
```
Now you can use `paymentToken` for payment by a cryptogram.

## Google Pay

- Create instance of CloudpaymentsGooglePay. Pass Google Pay Evironemnt (test or production) into constructor.

```dart
 final googlePay = CloudpaymentsGooglePay(GooglePayEnvironment.production);
 ```

 - Check whether Google Pay is available on this device and can process payment requests.

```dart
final isGooglePayAvailable = await googlePay.isGooglePayAvailable();
```

- Request payment.

```
 final result = await googlePay.requestGooglePayPayment(
    price: '430.6',
    currencyCode: 'RUB',
    countryCode: 'RU',
    merchantName: 'Example Merchant',
    publicId: 'test_api_00000000000000000000002',
);

if (result != null) {
    if (result.isSuccess) {
      final paymentToken = result.token;
    }
}

```
Now you can use `paymentToken` for payment by a cryptogram.
